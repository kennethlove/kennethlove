# Howdy ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kenneth Love but I prefer `klove` (kay love).
I'm an engineering manager at [O'Reilly Media](https://oreilly.com).
I'm also a longtime Python and Django engineer, now learning Rust in my free time.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on various projects.

  To learn Rust, my most recent or most worked on projects:

  - [hangry-games](https://github.com/kennethlove/hangry-games) A _Hunger Games_ simulator. This was v1.
    It only runs on desktop.
  - [hangrier_games](https://github.com/kennethlove/hangier_games) A _Hunger Games_ simulator, v2.
    this one will be playable in your browser.
  - [skidmarks](https://github.com/kennethlove/skidmarks) A streak tracker for daily/weekly streaks.

  My top Python/Django libraries are:

  - [django-braces](https://github.com/brack3t/django-braces) Mixins for Django's class-based views.
    Makes CBVs easier and nicer to work with.
  - [django-brackets](https://github.com/brack3t/django-brackets) A spiritual successor to `django-braces`.
    More class-based view mixins.
  - [django-drifter](https://github.com/kennethlove/django-drifter) A tool for quickly reseting migrations during development.
  - [django-middle-management](https://github.com/kennethlove/django-middle-management) A tool for currently
    running management commands remotely.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust, but also about self-hosting. It's been fun getting back
  to building servers again, even if it's just for fun. I'm also learning Mandarin!

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Python, Django, basic Rust, programming in general. Anything, really.
